# Technical Specification: HashedSessionStorage Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the technical specifications for implementing a session storage wrapper in TypeScript, referred to as `HashedSessionStorage`. This wrapper will automatically generate a fixed size hash key for each stored item and is designed to increase the cache hit rate and improve retrieval speed in the application.

## Detailed Design

### Key Components

1. **Crypto-JS**: We will use the Crypto-JS library for hash key generation. Crypto-JS is a collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

2. **HashedSessionStorage**: This is a TypeScript class that serves as a wrapper around the standard Session Storage API. It includes methods to add, retrieve, and delete items, and to clear the storage.

### Implementation Details

The `HashedSessionStorage` class will include the following methods:

1. `stringifySorted()`: This method takes a JSON object and returns a string representation of the object with its properties sorted in order. This is used to ensure a consistent string representation of an object, regardless of the order of its properties.

2. `generateHashKey()`: This method generates a fixed-size SHA-256 hash key based on the provided key. If the key is a string, it simply hashes the string. If the key is a JSON object, it first converts the object to a sorted string using `stringifySorted()`, then hashes the string.

3. `setItem()`, `getItem()`, `removeItem()`, `clear()`: These methods work the same way as their counterparts in the Session Storage API, but they automatically generate a hash key for each item.

## Importance and Benefits

Using sorted keys and fixed size hash keys in session storage has two main benefits:

1. **Increased Cache Hit Rate**: By sorting the properties of an object before generating the hash key, we ensure that two objects with the same properties but in a different order will produce the same hash key. This increases the likelihood of cache hits because the same data (regardless of the order of its properties) will always be retrieved with the same key.

2. **Improved Retrieval Speed**: Using fixed-size hash keys (in this case, SHA-256 keys) can improve retrieval speed. Since these keys are always the same length, the time complexity for retrieval operations remains constant, regardless of the size or complexity of the original data. This can make a significant difference in performance when dealing with large datasets.

## Considerations

While this approach has clear benefits, it also has some potential downsides:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Sorting the properties of objects and generating hash keys can introduce some performance overhead, especially for large objects or large numbers of operations.

2. **Limited Access**: Once items are stored using the `HashedSessionStorage` class, they can only be accessed using the class. Direct access via the Session Storage API is not possible because the keys are hashed.

These issues should be kept in mind when deciding whether to implement this approach in a given application.
